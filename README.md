# php_loppuharkka

A final project in PHP course. The goal was to make a dummy shop.
I approached the solution by making fake api for soap sales.

# TODO: FIX BROKEN PICTURE URLs (free hosting didn't take me far)
# Pictures wont show because of that.

## Hosted at:

If site doesn't open there is either a maintance going on. 
Or I have to renew the free hosting. While being very modest it 
resulted in full grades.
